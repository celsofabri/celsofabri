Hello, I'm Front-End Developer! Welcome to my profile :space_invader:

#### :fox_face: About Me
Currently I'm work at [Bcredi](https://www.bcredi.com.br/) as Front-End Developer, but I already worked in other companies such as [MadeiraMadeira](https://www.madeiramadeira.com.br/), [EBANX](https://ebanx.com/br), [Snowman Labs](https://snowmanlabs.com.br), [IMAM](https://imam.ag), [WX](https://agenciawx.com.br) and [Andaraki](https://andaraki.com.br). 

I'm graduate in the course _Production Multimedia (Web Design)_ by _Opet University_. I have visual skills as UX/UI Designer, but my focus is front-end development. Currently, I'm work with ReactJS and learning a bit about VueJS.
